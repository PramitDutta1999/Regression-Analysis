# Regression-Analysis
 
# Major Project: Linear Regression and Statistical Modeling

This repository contains the implementation and mathematical analysis of multiple linear regression techniques and their applications, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP), and Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR). Additionally, it explores the use of regression for classification tasks, focusing on practical data analysis with Python.

The datasets used for this project include:
- The `House Price Dataset`, containing various attributes of houses and their prices.
- The `Titanic Dataset`, used for classification tasks like predicting survival on the Titanic.

The project evaluates models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score, with detailed mathematical foundations provided for each method.
